# Exploring-Node.js-and-Express.js
Exercises about Node.js and Express.js

## How to run the app

1. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/KevinRebakure/Exploring-Node.js-and-Express.js.git`
2. Switch to the `simple-developer-portfolio` branch
3. Run `nodemon src/app.js` command in your terminal. I normally stick to `powershell` but because of windows' restrictions it may not work. I used `git bash` as an alternative, but you may also try any other terminal and see if it works.
4. Enjoy the project. Give me a star wouldn't hurt 😂 and you're free to fork and contribute to it 😁
